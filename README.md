## 1. Design Decisions

- **UI Consistency:** Carefully matched the WhatsApp design (colors, fonts, icons, and spacing) to ensure pixel-perfect accuracy.  
- **Theme Support:** Implemented both light and dark modes to enhance usability and provide a modern user experience.  
- **Responsive Layout:** Used `ScreenUtils` and `Flexible/Expanded` widgets to ensure the app adapts to different screen sizes.  

---

## 2. Best Practices

- **Clean Architecture:** Code organized by features (`home`, `chat`, `stories`) with separate `widgets` folders for reusability.  
- **State Management:** Simple state handled with Provider/Riverpod (lightweight and production-ready).  
- **Separation of Concerns:** UI, logic, and theme separated to make the project scalable.

## 3. Implemented Features

- **Screens Delivered:**  
  1. Home (chat list)  
  2. Chat (conversation)  
  3. Stories (status)  

- **Animations/Microinteractions:**  
  - **Hero Animation** when opening a chat from the home list.  
  - **Send Button Animation** (feedback animation on sending a message).  
  - **Optional Transition** for switching between stories.  

- **High Fidelity:** Fonts, colors, icons, and spacing are aligned with WhatsAppâ€™s design language.

## 4. Quality Assurance

- Tested on multiple device sizes and orientations.  
- Verified both light and dark themes.  
- Ensured smooth navigation and animations.
